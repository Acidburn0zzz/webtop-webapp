<!--
	The basic structure of this configuration file can be described as 
	<configuration> element containing one or more <service> elements.
	Then each service elements must contain one or more <dataSource> 
	elements.
	
	The <service> element
	Very simple element providing only 'id' attribute that represents 
	the service ID. Each id attributes must be unique and differ from 
	the others. The configuration file must contains at least a <service> 
	element specifying "com.sonicle.webtop.core" as id, in order to define
	the main platform data source.
	
	<service id="my.service.id">
		...
	</service>
	
	The <dataSource> element
	Element that represents a configuration set for a data source.
	Structure must define the following attributes:
	- name  (Default: "default")
		The data source name.
	- [jdbc4] dataSourceClassName (Required)
		This is the name of the DataSource class provided by the JDBC driver.
	- [jdbc4] serverName  (Required)
	- [jdbc4] port
	- [jdbc4] databaseName  (Required)
	- [jdbc3] driverClassName  (Required)
		This is the name of the Driver class provided by the JDBC driver.
	- [jdbc3] jdbcUrl  (Required)
		A suitable connection url to use with specified Driver.
	- username
	- password
	- autoCommit  (Default: true)
		This property controls the default auto-commit behavior of 
		connections returned from the pool.
	- connectionTimeout  (Default: 30000)
		This property controls the maximum number of milliseconds that 
		a client (that's you) will wait for a connection from the pool.
	- idleTimeout  (Default: 600000)
		This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection 
		is allowed to sit idle in the pool. 
	- maxLifetime  (Default: 1800000)
		This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. 
		When a connection reaches this timeout it will be retired from the pool.
	- minimumIdle  (Default: like maximumPoolSize)
		This property controls the minimum number of idle connections that 
		system tries to maintain in the pool.
	- maximumPoolSize  (Default: 10)
		This property controls the maximum size that the pool is allowed to 
		reach, including both idle and in-use connections.
	
	Jdbc4 basic example:
	
	<dataSource name="my.data.source.name" 
		dataSourceClassName="my.data.source.class.name" 
		serverName="my.server.name" 
		username="my.username" 
		password="my.password" 
		databaseName="my.db.name" 
	/>
	
	Jdbc3 basic example:
	
	<dataSource name="my.data.source.name" 
		driverClassName="my.driver.class.name" 
		jdbcUrl="my.jdbc.url" 
		username="my.username" 
		password="my.password" 
	/>
